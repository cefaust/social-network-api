# social-network-api

## Description
With this project I was tasked in creating an API for a social network. It will use a NoSQL database, so
that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Things I included the project
1. When the user starts the application using `npm start`, then the server is started and the Mongoose models
are synced to the MongoDB database.
2. When the user opens API get routes for users and thoughts in Insomnia,  then the data for each is 
displayed in a formatted JSON.
3. When the user test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then the user is successfully create, 
update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.
4. When the user test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then the user is able to successfully create and delete 
reactions to the thoughts and add and remove friends to the user's friends list.
